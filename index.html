  <p>If you choose to enable in-app analytics, only anonymous usage events (e.g. how often you start the timer) may be sent to Google Analytics. No personal identifiers are ever collected.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We donâ€™t integrate with any third-party SDKs that collect personal data.</p>
